# Spring Data Rest Demo: Add a JavaScript UI

While it's great to see data in JSON format, it's even more fun to put a UI on it and see if we can drive some more interesting behavior.  In this part of the demo you will add a JavaScript UI to the application.

## Add the Single Page

Since this will be a SPA (Single Page Application), we need the single page.  This is nothing but an index.html that will eventually hold our Web Components.
